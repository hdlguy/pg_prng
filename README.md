This is a very light weight fpga pseudorandom number generator.

This pseudorandom number generator is designed to be efficient and fast when implemented in fpga logic.

A simulation test bench is provided which saves the sequence to a file.  Then an Octave .m file is used to compare the performance with the rand() function.

It is pretty good.
